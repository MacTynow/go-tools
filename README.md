My personal collection of Golang related tools and scripts.

No guarantees and no cost (unless you wanna buy me a beer)


## Currently this includes:
* ./fiximports/ - formats imports properly (but does not fix them)
* ./gonerator/ - a simple go code generator
* ./package-coverage/ - a tool to generate cumulative coverage of a per package level (including children)
* ./regex/ - a regex based refactoring tool
