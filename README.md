My personal collection of Golang related tools and scripts.

No guarantees and no cost (unless you wanna buy me a beer)


## Currently this includes:
* ./gonerator/ - a simple go code generator
* ./package-coverage/ - a tool to generate cumulative coverage of a per package level (including children)
* ./scripts/gometalinter.sh - a script to call https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter with my settings
